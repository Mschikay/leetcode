# Do a BFS on multiple sources: the squares of the given matrix that have a 0.
# Every time you visit a node, it will be from a path of predecessors that is of shortest distance to a zero.
# the former elements must be closer than the latter

# Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use
# yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory.
